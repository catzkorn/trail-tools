# Trail tools

A website that is both an example of a full stack Go/React/TS/Postgres app and a bunch of useful trail running tools!

## Prerequisites

- Go
- Docker

## Running

To start Postgres, Dex and run the server locally, use:

```
$ make run
```

## Development

To run the server with auto-rebuild of the frontend and CSS, run:

```
$ make watch
```

Change to the Go server requires restarting the command.
